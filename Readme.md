# 🏅 Olympics SQL Database Project – Complete (Phase 1 to 4)

A full-scale SQL project simulating a real-world Olympics database system. This multi-phase journey takes you from data modeling and basic queries to complex transactions, procedures, triggers, and analytics.

---

## 📘 Overview

This project simulates the backend database system of the Olympic Games. It includes:
- Schema design
- Data insertion
- Analytical queries
- Real-world business logic
- Secure data control
- Automation via triggers

---

## 🚀 Phases Summary

### 🔹 Phase 1 – Schema Design & Sample Data
- Designed and created core tables:
  - `Athletes`, `Events`, `Sports`, `Countries`, `Teams`, `Medals`, `Coaches`, `Referees`, `Olympics`, `Venues`
- Populated tables with ~20 sample records each
- Implemented primary and foreign key relationships
- Wrote basic SELECT queries for data retrieval

---

### 🔹 Phase 2 – Expanded Database & Intermediate Queries
- Wrote 250+ queries including:
  - Table updates and deletes (DML)
  - Data type changes and column modifications (DDL)
  - Used Operators for calculations and complex logic.
- Simulated use cases like event scheduling, doping checks, ticket analysis

---

### 🔹 Phase 3 – Advanced SQL and Analytics
- Deep dive into:
  - Multi-table JOINS (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL, SELF)
  - Subqueries (nested, correlated)
  - Built-in functions (`AVG`, `COUNT`, `DATE`, etc.)
  - User-defined functions (UDFs)
- Tables analyzed: `Athletes`, `Medals`, `Events`, `Olympics`, `Broadcasts`, `Judges`, etc.
- Developed data analysis views and decision-focused reports

---

### 🔹 Phase 4 – Views, CTEs, Procedures, DCL/TCL, Triggers
- 📌 **Views**: Created to simplify queries, e.g., `rich_countries`, `medal_winning_teams`
- 🧾 **CTEs**: Implemented for reusable queries and analytics
- 🛠 **Stored Procedures**: Insert/update data across all key entities
- 🔐 **DCL**: Role-based access (`GRANT`, `REVOKE`) for analysts, editors, admins
- 🔁 **TCL**: Transaction control with `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`, `SAVEPOINT`
- ⚡ **Triggers**: Enforced rules & logged activity (e.g., block underweight athletes)

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **SQL Engine**: MySQL / PostgreSQL
- **Tools**: MySQL Workbench, DBeaver, pgAdmin
- **Language**: Standard SQL

---

## 🧠 Learning Goals

- Master SQL from basics to advanced levels
- Learn professional database development practices
- Build confidence in DDL, DML, DCL, TCL, Views, CTEs, Procedures, Triggers
- Prepare for real-world data roles in analytics, development, or BI
