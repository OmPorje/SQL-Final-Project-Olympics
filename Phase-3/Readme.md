# 🏅 Olympics SQL Database Project - Phase 3

A comprehensive relational database project to model and analyze Olympic Games data. This project is organized in **multiple phases**, focusing on real-world database design, querying, and advanced SQL operations.

## 📦 Project Structure

- `Olympics Phase-1.sql` – Sets up foundational tables and populates them with initial data.
- `Olympics Phase-2.sql` – Adds complex queries, additional entities, and advanced SQL operations.
- `Olympics Phase-3.sql` – Contains advanced analytics queries, subqueries, joins, functions, and optimizations.

## 🔍 Phase 3 Highlights

- Complex analytics with:
  - Subqueries
  - Built-in functions
  - User-defined functions (UDFs)
  - Various types of SQL Joins (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL OUTER, SELF JOIN)
- Deep insights on countries, sports, athletes, events, matches, medals, broadcasts, judges, referees, and schedules

## 🧠 Learning Goals

- Understand how to model a large-scale event database
- Practice advanced SQL: subqueries, joins, functions, DDL/DML operations
- Learn data insights and reporting using SQL queries

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- MySQL / PostgreSQL (standard SQL syntax)
- SQL Clients (MySQL Workbench, pgAdmin, DBeaver)


## 📚 How to Use

1. Load the SQL scripts in your SQL client.
2. Execute `Olympics Phase-1.sql` to create base tables and insert data.
3. Execute `Olympics Phase-2.sql` for queries on DDL, DML, DQL, Clauses and Operators.
4. Execute `Olympics Phase-3.sql` to run advanced queries and analytics.
5. Explore and customize queries as per your learning needs.
