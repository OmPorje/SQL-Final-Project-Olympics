# 🏅 Olympics SQL Database Project - Phase 2

A comprehensive relational database project to model and analyze Olympic Games data. This project is organized in **multiple phases**, focusing on real-world database design, querying, and advanced SQL operations.

## 📦 Project Structure

- `Olympics Phase-1.sql` – Sets up foundational tables and populates them with initial data.
- `Olympics Phase-2.sql` – Adds complex queries, additional entities, and advanced SQL operations.

## ✅ Phase 1 Highlights

- Creation of key tables: `Athletes`, `Countries`, `Sports`, `Events`, `Olympics`, `Venues`, `Teams`, `Medals`, `Coaches`, `Referees`,....
- INSERT queries with realistic sample data (~20 records per table)
- Foreign key relationships and constraints
- Basic SELECT queries to retrieve and analyze data

## 🚀 Phase 2 Highlights
- 250+ SQL queries:
  - Aggregations, Subqueries, JOINs, Filtering
  - DDL (ALTER, ADD COLUMN), DML (UPDATE, DELETE)
  - Real-world scenarios like filtering by session, injury tracking, ticketing analysis, viewership, etc.

## 🧠 Learning Goals

- Understand how to model a large-scale event database
- Practice advanced SQL: subqueries, joins, functions, DDL/DML operations
- Learn data insights and reporting using SQL queries

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- MySQL / PostgreSQL (standard SQL syntax)
- SQL Clients (MySQL Workbench, pgAdmin, DBeaver)

## 📚 How to Use

1. Load the SQL scripts in your SQL client.
2. Execute `Olympics Phase-1.sql` first to create base tables and insert data.
3. Then execute `Olympics Phase-2.sql` to add advanced queries and new tables.
4. Explore, modify, and analyze using your own SQL queries.

## 📈 Sample Concepts Covered

- Olympic event scheduling and broadcast management
- Team formation, medal tracking, and athlete data analysis
