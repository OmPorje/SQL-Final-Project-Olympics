# 🏅 Olympics Database Project – Phase 1

This project is part of a multi-phase initiative to build a comprehensive relational database for managing Olympic Games data. The Phase 1 SQL script sets up the foundational schema and populates several core tables related to athletes, events, sports, countries, and results.

## 📁 Contents

- **SQL Script**: `Olympics Phase-1.sql`
  - Contains `CREATE TABLE` and `INSERT INTO` statements for multiple tables.
  - Includes realistic sample data for testing queries.

## 📌 Features Implemented in Phase 1

- ✅ Creation of key tables such as:
  - `athletes`
  - `events`
  - `sports`
  - `countries`
  - `results`
- ✅ Each table includes:
  - Clear primary and foreign key relationships
  - Descriptive comments for columns
  - Sample data entries (approx. 20 records each)

## 🧠 Purpose

This project is designed to:
- Practice relational database design principles
- Work with realistic data modeling for sports and events
- Enable complex SQL queries for analytics, reporting, and insights

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- SQL (MySQL/PostgreSQL compatible)
- Sample queries (select, join, aggregation – to be added in later phases)

## 📚 How to Use

1. Open your preferred SQL client (e.g., MySQL Workbench, pgAdmin).
2. Execute the `Olympics Phase-1.sql` script to create and populate the database.
3. Start running your own SQL queries to explore the data.
