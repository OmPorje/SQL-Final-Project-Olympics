# 🏅 Olympics SQL Database Project - Phase 4

A comprehensive multi-phase relational database project to model and analyze Olympic Games data. This project covers data modeling, real-world queries, analytics, security, triggers, transactions, and performance optimization.

---

## 📦 Project Structure

- `Olympics Phase-1.sql` – Foundational schema & basic records
- `Olympics Phase-2.sql` – Intermediate queries & extended tables
- `Olympics Phase-3.sql` – Advanced joins, subqueries, UDFs, analytical SQL
- `Olympics Phase-4.sql` – Views, CTEs, Procedures, DCL, TCL, and Triggers

---

## ✅ Phase 4 Highlights

- 📊 **Views**:
  - Simplify queries with named virtual tables
  - E.g. `rich_countries`, `female_athletes`, `team_sports`, `main_stadiums`

- 🔁 **CTEs (Common Table Expressions)**:
  - Use temporary named result sets for cleaner logic
  - Examples: Top 3 tallest athletes, medal counts per team, venue capacity ranks

- ⚙️ **Stored Procedures**:
  - Reusable SQL blocks for inserting and updating
  - Covers `Countries`, `Athletes`, `Events`, `Matches`, `Medals`, etc.

- 🔐 **DCL (Data Control Language)**:
  - Permissions management (`GRANT`, `REVOKE`)
  - Simulate real-world user roles (e.g. analyst, coach, intern)

- 🔄 **TCL (Transaction Control Language)**:
  - Transactions, Savepoints, Rollbacks, and Commits for safe updates
  - Realistic update scenarios with rollback checkpoints

- 🧠 **Triggers**:
  - Automatically log actions or enforce rules
  - E.g. prevent invalid inserts, log medal winners, update schedule logs

## 🧠 Learning Objectives

- Master advanced SQL features across multiple categories
- Learn how databases are managed in professional environments
- Practice secure, scalable, and maintainable SQL coding patterns

---

## 🛠️ Technologies

- SQL: MySQL/PostgreSQL
- Tools: MySQL Workbench, DBeaver, pgAdmin

---

## 📚 How to Run

1. Execute `Olympics Phase-1.sql` to set up tables and seed data.
2. Run `Olympics Phase-2.sql` and `Olympics Phase-3.sql` to add queries and logic.
3. Use `Olympics Phase-4.sql` for advanced operations and simulations.
4. Run your own queries and analyze the dataset freely.
